# Enrf24_TX_Final
TX side of final project for Microprocessors

This project was written in Code Composure Studio using Energia libraries for the MSP430. The code will accept a text string from a serial terminal and transmit the string using an ENRF_24 2.4 GHz wifi adapter to another ENRF_24 adapter connected to a different MSP430 with a connected LCD screen for display.
